# TeyvatWorldStone
这是为了记录和纪念那些曾经存在和生活于特瓦特的旅行者们  
This is to record and commemorate the travelers who have existed and lived in Teyvat  

总有一天，提瓦特世界将会迎来终点，对于提瓦特的人民而言，他们的故事仍会继续，但是对于世界之外的我们，将再也无法参与到其中。为了不让未来的自己遗憾，现在启动名为提瓦特世界石的项目，意在在现实世界中保留下我们在提瓦特世界中的生活记录。  
One day, the world of Teyvat will come to an end, and for the people of Teyvat, their story will continue, but for us outside the world, we will no longer be able to participate in it. In order not to let our future selves regret, we are now launching a project called Teyvat World Stone, which is intended to preserve the record of our life in the Teyvat world in the real world.
